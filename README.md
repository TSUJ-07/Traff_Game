# Traff_Game
Hope this works

"Traff_Game is a project made with the purpose to entertain it's players. As one of the creators of this game, it is our duty to create an optimal game experience for our players.
The key to Traff_Game is simple, avoid traffic. As you swerve through traffic, limit any collision to neighboring cars in nearby lanes. As the game progresses, the content will become more difficult to maneuver around oncoming vehicles.
This project will utilize many skills devoloped throughout the course of '1321 Programming and Problem Solving,' and showcase our relative understanding of Pygame."
